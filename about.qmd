## About Me

I'm a data enthusiast focused on turning complex information into clear, actionable insights.  
What started as curiosity has evolved into hands-on experience building Python scripts, writing SQL queries, and creating clean, effective visualizations.  
I enjoy solving real-world problems with data and helping others make informed decisions.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, gaming, and spending time with my family.
