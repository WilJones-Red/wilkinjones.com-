# Paper Airplane Experiment – Two-Way ANOVA Analysis

This project involved flying paper airplanes with different designs and paper weights to determine how these two factors — individually and together — affect flight distance.

## 🧪 Hypotheses Tested

### 1. Interaction Between Design and Weight
- **H₀**: No interaction between plane design and paper weight  
- **Hₐ**: There is interaction between plane design and paper weight

### 2. Factor 1: Plane Design
- **H₀**: All plane designs have the same mean flight distance  
- **Hₐ**: At least one plane design differs

### 3. Factor 2: Paper Weight
- **H₀**: All paper weights yield the same mean flight distance  
- **Hₐ**: At least one paper weight differs

## 📊 Data Collection

Each of the 6 combinations (3 designs × 2 paper weights) was flown 10 times, with distance recorded. The results were analyzed using a **two-way ANOVA** to check for interaction and main effects.

## 📈 ANOVA Results

- The **p-value for interaction** was **0.005**, which is **less than ɑ = 0.05**
- ➤ This means there **is a significant interaction** between plane design and paper weight
- Because interaction was present, main effects were not interpreted independently

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Manual flight testing and randomized trials
- Data summarized and evaluated in Excel
- Two-way ANOVA completed and interpreted as part of statistical coursework

## 📌 Conclusion

The experiment confirmed that the effectiveness of a plane design **depends on the type of paper used**, and vice versa. Interaction effects are real and impactful — emphasizing the importance of context when designing experiments.
