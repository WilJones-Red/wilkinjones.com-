# Bike Rentals Prediction Case Study

## 🚲 Project Summary
This project aimed to predict hourly bike rental demand using deep learning. I engineered temporal and contextual features, such as COVID-era flags and holiday indicators, to capture patterns in bike usage from 2011 through 2024.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for scripting and modeling
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for building deep learning models
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data cleaning and transformation
- **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
- **Matplotlib** for plotting results
- **Quarto** for documentation

## 🧪 Key Techniques Used

✅ **Feature Engineering**  
Created contextual features such as COVID-phase indicators, time-based encodings (year, month, day of year), and workday splits.

✅ **Neural Network Training**  
Built and trained a 3-layer deep neural network to learn rental behavior patterns.

✅ **Model Evaluation**  
Used metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² to evaluate performance. Validated visually with residual and error plots.

✅ **Overfitting Mitigation**  
Included dropout layers and used training history to assess stability between training and validation loss.

## 📊 Results Summary
- **MAE**: 54.97  
- **MSE**: 7010.54  
- **R² Score**: 0.94 (94% variance explained)

My model predicted bike rentals with high accuracy, correctly capturing 94% of the trends in the data. On average, its predictions were within about 55 rentals of the actual number. It performed especially well in the period after COVID, when demand patterns began to stabilize and rise again.
