# Bike Rentals Prediction Case Study

## 🚲 Project Summary
This project aimed to predict hourly bike rental demand using deep learning. We engineered temporal and contextual features, such as COVID-era flags and holiday indicators, to capture patterns in bike usage from 2011 through 2024.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for scripting and modeling
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for building deep learning models
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data cleaning and transformation
- **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
- **Matplotlib** for plotting results
- **Quarto** for documentation

## 🧪 Key Techniques Used

✅ **Feature Engineering**  
Created contextual features such as COVID-phase indicators, time-based encodings (year, month, day of year), and workday splits.

✅ **Neural Network Training**  
Built and trained a 3-layer deep neural network to learn rental behavior patterns.

✅ **Model Evaluation**  
Used metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² to evaluate performance. Validated visually with residual and error plots.

✅ **Overfitting Mitigation**  
Included dropout layers and used training history to assess stability between training and validation loss.

## 📊 Results Summary
- **MAE**: 54.97
- **MSE**: 7010.54
- **R² Score**: 0.94 (94% variance explained)

The model shows strong predictive power and generalization, particularly post-COVID where user demand rebounded.
