# Objective

The goal of this case study was to develop a model that could accurately predict home prices using machine learning techniques. We aimed to explore which features most influence home values and how machine learning could improve prediction performance overall.

# Data & Feature Engineering

We used a housing dataset containing location coordinates, condition scores, and other physical characteristics. We also engineered additional features to enrich the model's understanding:

- **Luxury Score**: Captured quality and size
- **Age**: Computed from the build year
- **View Score**: Captured aesthetic value
- **Latitude and Longitude**: Used as geographic proxies for proximity to amenities

These features were designed to bring out hidden patterns in the data.

# Model Approach

We used a **blended ensemble** of two models:

- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

Each model was tuned to prevent overfitting and ensure stable predictions. The final output was an average of both model predictions, followed by minor adjustments to better handle outliers.

# Results

Our final model achieved:

- **Median Error**: $33,842.78
- **Mean Error**: $58,787.90
- **% Median Error**: 7.62%
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: $109,329.21
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.9108

These results indicate the model captured over 91% of the variance in housing prices.

# Key Insights

- **Location matters**: Latitude and longitude proved highly predictive.
- **Feature engineering added value**: The luxury score and view variables helped detect price drivers not apparent in raw data.
- **Blending models improved accuracy**: Combining XGBoost and Random Forest reduced extreme error cases.

# Limitations

- The dataset lacked some key external data, such as:
  - Local income levels
  - School rankings
- Rare luxury properties were outliers and more difficult to model

# Conclusion

Our ensemble model predicted home prices with high accuracy and generalizability. Strategic feature engineering and model blending were key to performance. This framework offers a strong foundation for future refinement, especially with the addition of external contextual data.
