# Tuberculosis Data Insights

This Tableau dashboard explores trends in tuberculosis (TB) cases globally using World Health Organization data. I analyzed key dimensions like **country**, **age group**, and **gender** to identify at-risk populations.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- India and China account for the majority of TB cases worldwide
- The 25–34 age group consistently had the highest number of cases
- Males reported significantly more cases than females across all years

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas)** – for cleaning and reshaping messy datasets
- **MySQL** – for structuring and storing cleaned data
- **Tableau** – for building interactive dashboards
